        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and evolving Cloud DevOps Engineer with a passion for modern IT practices, especially in Kubernetes and Site Reliability Engineering. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into the cloud-native ecosystem, where I’ve honed my skills in building scalable and reliable cloud platforms.</p>
        <p>Being bilingual in English and German, I enjoy working in diverse environments, collaborating with teams to solve complex technical challenges. I’m always curious about new technologies and eager to expand my knowledge and skillset. The Kubernetes and CNCF ecosystem has become a space where I truly feel at home, and I’m excited to explore the endless possibilities that cloud technologies have to offer.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am deeply motivated by a constant desire to improve and adapt. The rapidly evolving nature of cloud technologies fuels my excitement for learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I believe that the key to success in this field is a combination of continuous learning, adaptability, and the ability to collaborate effectively with others.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am at Swisscom, leading initiatives to bring innovative cloud solutions to the banking sector. I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to further develop my expertise and contribute to building cutting-edge, reliable infrastructure solutions.</p>
